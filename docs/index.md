# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

The Avera G-60 is a new open-source electric guitar design. I've developed this guitar to meet my ideals for sound quality and flexibility, ergonomics, and aesthetics. Although different elements of this design may be familiar, the full set of features is one that I could not find anywhere in the existing guitar market. This is what drove the project. Design files and documentation have been made freely available for download. If you are interested in doing your own build, check out the other info on this site and the files on the Download page.
