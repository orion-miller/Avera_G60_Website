I've developed this guitar to reflect my ideal preferences for sound quality and flexibility, ergonomics, and aesthetics. Although different elements of this design may be familiar, the full set of features is one that I could not find in the existing guitar market. This is what drove the project. Design files and documentation have been made freely available for download.

This allows for any amount of blend between the positions unlike a 3 or 5-way switch. When the volume pot is pulled out, the pickups are connected in series as with a humbucker, for increased output and thicker sound. In this case the pickup blend has no effect.</p> <p>When the tone pot is pushed in, it functions like a conventional tone pot, cutting high frequencies. When the tone pot is pulled out, it cuts low frequencies instead.</p> <p>The toggle switch allows the phase of the pickups to be reversed. When phase is reversed, there is cancellation between the 2 pickups waveforms for a thinner and quirkier sound.</p> <p>A wiring diagram is given below.
